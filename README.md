# Internet-radio-multimedia-via-IP
This project presents the design and implementation of an Internet Television system that leverages multicasting techniques for efficient multimedia delivery over IP networks. The system is built using a client-server architecture where a multicast server manages multiple channels, enabling clients to dynamically select and view various streams.
